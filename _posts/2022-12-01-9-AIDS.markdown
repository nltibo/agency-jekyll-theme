description: AIDS, or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, is a disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV attacks and weakens the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight off infections and diseases. AIDS is the most severe stage of HIV infection, and can be transmitted through the exchange of certain bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk, so is often sexually transmitted between individuals. It can also be transmitted from an HIV-positive mother to her baby during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. It was initially called the Gay-Related Immune Deficiency as young gay men were majoritarily affected by the virus due to their sexual practices at the time. However, many cases were also reported in drug users. In 1999, Dr. Mark Weinberg developed 3TC, a drug used to treat HIv which declined AIDS-related deaths between 60 and 80%. However, in 2000, the exponential transmission of AIDS in Africa concerned the World Health Organisation, until it actually became an actual threat by causing at least 14 million deaths around the continent. Further medical advancements allowed the creation of an HIV vaccine ten years later and the approval of HIV preventative drug pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which is a HIV prevention medication taken by people who are HIV-negative to reduce their risks of becoming infected with HIV. There is currently no cure for AIDS, but antiretroviral therapy can effectively manage HIV infection and prevent the development and transmission of AIDS. Today, most HIV-positive people that stay on treatment can live long, healthy and close-to-normal lives, even though there is still too much judgment and feeling of humiliation around the disease. The HIV/AIDS epidemic, which was once considered a death sentence, is now manageable for those with access to proper healthcare. However, it continues to disproportionately affect LGBTQ+ communities, who are often marginalized and not represented in mainstream media. Hollywood’s early portrayals of HIV has helped some people care about an epidemic that they had previously ignored, marking an important turning point in public awareness. Movies have presented on screen activists to the world and put human faces to the disease, who were sympathetic and reliable characters, warning that no one is safe from HIV and that cautious measures should be taken when dealing with it.

analysis: In plots narrating the stories of HIV-positive characters, words associated with diagnosis and the medical aspect of HIV frequently appear, such as “diagnosed”, “AID”, “HIV”, “discover”, “doctor”, “death” and “help”. Since HIV is a sexually transmitted disease and gay and bisexual men were the population most affected by HIV throughout history, the words “protection”, as in sexual protection, and “gay” are also often used in the plot summaries.
