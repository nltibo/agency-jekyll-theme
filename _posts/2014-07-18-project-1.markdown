description: World War II was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's nations  —including all of the great powers—  eventually forming the Allies and the Axis, two opposing military alliances. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries. In a state of "total war", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centers (in which approximately one million people were killed), it resulted in 50 million to over 70 million fatalities.
