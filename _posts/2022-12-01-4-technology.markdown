analysis: In the Digital Revolution word cloud plots, the words “phone”, “computer” and “camera” are considered as the most frequently used, these are directly associated with the main early 2000s revolutionary devices. The word “new” emphasizes the innovative aspect of technologies, especially these last decades and the word “house” could suggest domotics house systems that are growing in popularity. “Police” is frequently used in technology themed movie plot summaries, probably because the most recent, cutting-edge technologies are used in detective movies to solve arduous crimes.
