description: Rock music has a long and rich history that dates back to the 1950s. It originated in the United States with Rock’n’Roll, drawing heavily from blues and country music, and it quickly gained popularity around the world. The Rock’n’Roll era is often associated with the emergence of icons such as Elvis Presley, Check Berry, and Little Richard, who helped define the now famous genre. In the 1960s, rock music underwent a major transformation with the emergence of bands who helped to popularize the genre and establish it as a mainstream form of music. In the 1970s and 1980s, rock music diversified and spawned numerous subgenres, such as hard rock, heavy metal, punk, and alternative rock, each with its own distinct sound and style, and all representing the new generation’s rebellious spirit. Today, rock music remains a popular and influential genre, with many contemporary artists drawing inspiration from its rich history and evolving it in new and innovative ways. Rock music has played a significant role in shaping the attitudes and values of the time that still have influence in our societies today. Many movies today try to capture the craze of the Rock’n’Roll era, musicians themselves have been playing different versions of themselves in films, turning stage stars into screen icons and writing their names in history.

analysis: The words that stand out the most in this word cloud plot are “band”, “music”, “love”, “sing”, “singer” and “song” which all explicitly evoke the profession of being a musician and of performing on stage. However, this vocabulary is not specific to the Rock genre, making it hard to identify the Rock era in the plot. Therefore, the dictionary used to classify movies into the Rock’n’Roll era might not be well defined or the movie dataset might not contain important movies narrating Rock’n’Roll.
