description: Rock music has a long and rich history that dates back to the 1950s. It originated in the United States, drawing heavily from blues and country music, and it quickly gained popularity around the world. In the 1960s, rock music underwent a major transformation with the emergence of bands who helped to popularize the genre and establish it as a mainstream form of music. In the 1970s and 1980s, rock music diversified and spawned numerous subgenres, such as hard rock, heavy metal, punk, and alternative rock, each with its own distinct sound and style. Today, rock music remains a popular and influential genre, with many contemporary artists drawing inspiration from its rich history and evolving it in new and innovative ways.

analysis: The words that stand out the most in this word cloud plot are “band”, “music”, “love”, “sing”, “singer” and “song” which all explicitly evoke the profession of being a musician and of performing on stage. However, this vocabulary is not specific to the Rock genre, making it hard to identify the Rock era in the plot. Therefore, the dictionary used to classify movies into the Rock’n’Roll era might not be well defined or the movie dataset might not contain important movies narrating Rock’n’Roll.
