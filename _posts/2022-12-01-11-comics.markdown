description: Comics are a medium that tells stories through the use of sequential art, often in the form of panels containing illustrations and text. Comics have a long history dating back to the late 1800s, and have evolved over the years to include a variety of genres such as action, adventure, romance, and comedy. Comics are often serialized, with each issue building upon the events of previous issues to create a larger narrative. They have had a significant impact on popular culture, with many iconic characters and storylines being adapted into films, television shows, and other media. The Golden Age of Comic Books began in June 1938 with the debut of Superman in Action Comics and Batman premiered less than a year later in Detective Comics. In October 1939, the very first Marvel comic was released, which led to a peak in comic book popularity the following years. Many films produced a spin-off of the most popular comics of the 20th century, creating huge blockbuster movies, marking generations for the years to come.
