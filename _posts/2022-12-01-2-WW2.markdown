description: World War II was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's nations —including all of the great powers— eventually forming the Allies (led by Great Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union) and the Axis (German, Itay, Japan), two opposing military alliances. WWII was a continuation of WWI’s Treaty of Versailles which imposed harsh penalties on Germany, building strong national humiliation  and creating an ideal atmosphere for Hitler to come to German power. The invasion of Warsaw by Germany was the triggering event of WWII, which urged Britain and France to declare war on Germany. The succession of gruesome combats made it the most widespread war in history, marked by mass deaths of civilians, especially the Holocaust that killed approximately 6 million jews, and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centers, it resulted in around 60 million fatalities. In 1945, Germany surrendered ending the war but the film world has never stopped fighting, nearly 78 years of production of world war movies is ever growing. WWII is still a popular topic today, being the most violent and complex war in history, through movies we all try to understand how it was possible for such atrocious events to even happen. Movies were also an unknown ally during the war, Hollywood’s efforts gave an astonishing boost to the morale and recruitment levels of the American armed forces, through the extensive use of films in propaganda and morale-boosting.

analysis: For most people, the first two words that come to mind when thinking of WWII are probably Hitler and Nazi. These two words are also the most used when describing a WWII movie plot summary as shown in this word cloud plot. Then, the words “German”, “Soviet”,  “resistance”, “war” and “army” appear frequently in the movie plot summaries, and are explicitly associated with WWII. The lexical field of war is highly present in the summaries, such as “attack”, “tank”, “invasion”, “kill”, “escape”, “allied”, “battle”, “soldier”, “help” and “return”.
