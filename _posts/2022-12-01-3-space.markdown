description: The space race was a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to explore and advance in the field of space exploration during the Cold War. The race began in the late 1950s and peaked in the 1960s, with both countries launching numerous spacecraft and sending astronauts into space. In 1961, the Soviet Union achieved a major milestone when Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit the Earth. The United States responded by launching the Apollo program, which ultimately succeeded in landing astronauts on the moon in 1969. The space race had significant implications for science and technology, as it spurred the development of new technologies and materials that have had major lasting impacts throughout history. It also had political and cultural significance, as it became a symbol of the technological and ideological competition between the two superpowers. The widely mediatised intensity of the space race created a new genre of cinema reacting to the cultural surge in cosmic interest. The vast unknown aspect of space led the way to horror movies reflecting the nation’s fear of extraterrestrial life and more recently to futuristic science-fiction movies, often depicting a drastic future for society shaped by disruptive technologies and a wrecked environment. These movies are full of warnings, reminding us to change our habits and to move away from destructive technologies.

analysis: With no surprise, in the plot summaries of movies telling space race and space exploration stories, the most frequently used words are “Space” , “planet” and “Earth”. “Moon”, “ship”, “launch”, “alien”, “mission”, “crew”, “rocket”, “astronaut”, “return” and “discover” all relate to space technology and extra-terrestrial conquest vocabularies. The word “first” also emerges in the word cloud plot, alluding to the Space Race between the US and Soviet Union during the end of the 20th century, especially when it is combined with the word “moon”.
