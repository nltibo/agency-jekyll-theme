description: Segregation refers to the separation of people based on race, ethnicity, religion, or other social or cultural characteristics. It is a longstanding issue in many societies and has often been used as a means of discrimination and oppression. Throughout history, segregation has taken many forms, including the separation of schools, housing, and public facilities based on race. In the United States, segregation was legally enforced through the "Jim Crow" laws in the South until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were passed. Despite these efforts, segregation persists in various forms and is still a major issue in many parts of the world.

analysis: In movies narrating racial segregation throughout history, the words “black”, “white”, “racial”, “apartheid”, “African” are the most frequently used to summarize the movies, which is expected since racial discriminations were ridiculously based on skin color, so white versus black. The word “south” also stands out in this word cloud plot, which might characterize South Africa as the apartheid institutionalized racial segregation between South Africa’s white minority and nonwhite majority for much of the latter half of the 20th century. Then the lexical field of support and community is present in the plot, such as “family”, “team” or “town”.
