description: Segregation refers to the separation of people based on race, ethnicity, religion, or other social or cultural characteristics. It is a longstanding issue in many societies and has often been used as a means of discrimination and oppression. Throughout history, segregation has taken many forms, including the separation of schools, housing, and public facilities based on race. In the United States, segregation was legally enforced through the "Jim Crow" laws in the South, which relegated Black people to the bottom of the economic order and labeled them as inferior, until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were passed. In South Africa, the apartheid institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination, legally excluding the non-white population. Black South Africans were subjected to forced removals from their homes, were denied the right to vote or hold political office, and were subjected to severe restrictions on their movement, education, and employment opportunities. They were also denied access to quality healthcare, housing, and other basic services. The apartheid regime was eventually dismantled in the 1990s, following the release of Nelson Mandela from prison and the negotiations that led to the establishment of a multi-party democracy in South Africa. Despite these efforts, segregation persists in various forms and is still a major issue in many parts of the world. Ordinary racism is still widely present around the world  and recent movements such as Black Lives Matter have been triggered due to unjustified murders of innocent Black people and the devaluation of Black lives in America.  Many politically-motivated movies condemn past and present racism present in our societies to educate the world about racism in the hope of finally putting an end to it in the future. Movies have the impressive power to make us relate to characters and feel profound empathy for them; there is no better way to pass on an important political message.

analysis: In movies narrating racial segregation throughout history, the words “black”, “white”, “racial”, “apartheid”, “African” are the most frequently used to summarize the movies, which is expected since racial discriminations were ridiculously based on skin color, so white versus black. The word “south” also stands out in this word cloud plot, which might characterize South Africa as the apartheid institutionalized racial segregation between South Africa’s white minority and nonwhite majority for much of the latter half of the 20th century. Then the lexical field of support and community is present in the plot, such as “family”, “team” or “town”.
